I have implemented edge based ROI detection which will be using canny edge detector for detection of edges and selects the largest contour as the Region Of Interest.

Advantages: It is computationally less expensive and handles varying object sizes
Disadvantages: sensitive to noise and might struggle with low intensities
improvements that can be made in future:
